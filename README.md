# Among Us Simon Game

A fun and interactive Simon game inspired by the popular game Among Us. Players must follow an increasingly complex pattern of lights and sounds to progress through the levels. Make it through 5 levels to win the game, but be carefulâ€”one wrong move and you'll have to start over!

## Features
- **Pattern Matching**: Follow a sequence of lights and sounds to advance through each level.
- **Dynamic Levels**: Each new level adds a new step to the previous pattern.
- **Audio Feedback**: Immediate audio feedback for both correct and incorrect inputs.
- **Light-Up Boxes**: Watch the boxes light up as part of the pattern and upon user interaction.
- **Game Over & Restart**: If you guess the pattern incorrectly, the game resets with a new pattern.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Click anywhere on the screen to start.
2. **Watch the Pattern**: The boxes will light up in a specific sequence. Remember the pattern!
3. **Repeat the Pattern**: Click the boxes in the same order as they were lit.
4. **Advance Through Levels**: Each level adds one new box to the pattern. Reach Level 5 to win!
5. **Reset on Failure**: If you guess incorrectly, the game will reset and you can try again.
